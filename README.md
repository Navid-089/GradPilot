# Project Setup Guide

This project supports both **GitHub Actions-based deployment** and **local development using `docker-compose`**, offering flexibility based on your use case.

---

##  Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure the following tools are installed:

- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)** (tested with Docker version 24+)
- **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)** (v2+ recommended)
- (Optional) **Git** and a GitHub account (for contributing or deployment)

To verify:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose --version
```

---

## Deploying  to the vm

In production, the application is deployed automatically using **GitHub Actions**.

### 1. GitHub Actions-based Deployment

When you push code to the `main` branch using:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

‚Üí The GitHub Actions pipeline is triggered, which:

- Builds Docker images for each microservice
- Pushes them to the container registry
- Connects to the VM via SSH
- Pulls the latest images
- Deploys the application behind an Nginx reverse proxy (domain configured via Namecheap)

üü¢ **By default**, the `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to use this **Docker image-based deployment setup** (usually at the bottom of the file).

---

##  Running Locally (Development Mode)

If you want to run and test the project locally without triggering CI or deploying, follow these steps:

### üîß Step-by-step instructions

1. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. **Comment out the production services block** (usually at the bottom).

3. **Uncomment the development services block** (usually at the top), which mounts your local source code directly for live development.

4. In `services/frontend/lib`, ensure the **port configuration** matches the exposed ports in `docker-compose.yml`. Avoid conflicts with other apps (e.g., Next.js on port 3000).

### 5. (Optional) Build and Run microservices individually

To test a microservice in isolation:

```bash
docker build -t microservice-name .
docker run -p 3000:3000 microservice-name
```

### 6. Run the full application locally using Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

 **Note**: Be careful of port conflicts. Adjust ports in both `docker-compose.yml` and your application files as needed.

## üîê Secrets & Environment Variables

This project uses `.env` files for local development, but no sensitive information is committed.

- Use `.env.example` as a template to create your own `.env` file.

- **Do not commit** `.env` files with actual credentials.
- For production and CI/CD, all secrets are stored in **GitHub Secrets** and injected into workflows securely.

---

## üöÄ CI/CD with GitHub Actions

The CI/CD pipeline automates everything on `push` to the `main` branch:

- Docker images are built and pushed
- VM pulls the latest images
- Nginx serves the updated deployment
- Domain and SSL handled via Namecheap + Nginx
