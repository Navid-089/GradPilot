#  Project Setup Guide

This project supports both **Github Actions-based deployment** and **local development using `docker-compose`**, offering flexibility based on your use case. Below you'll find detailed instructions for both.

---

##  Running with Docker (Production / Deployment)

To run the entire application using Docker, follow these steps:

### 1. Ensure Docker is installed
Install Docker on your system: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### 2. Build and Run required microsystems
```bash
docker build -t microservice-name .
docker run -p 3000:3000 microservice-name
```

Alternatively, you can use Docker Compose to run the whole application:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

üü¢ By default, the `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to use the **Docker image-based deployment configuration** (the lower section of the file).

---

##  Running Locally (Development Mode)

If you want to run the project locally (without building full Docker images), some changes are needed:

###  Step-by-step

1. Open `docker-compose.yml`.

2. **Comment out the production configuration block** (usually located **at the bottom** of the file).

3. **Uncomment the development services block** (usually located **at the top** of the file), which directly mounts your local source code.

4. Update ports inside `services/frontend/lib` to avoid any conflict and ensure proper routing.

5. Run:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

 **Note**: Make sure ports in `services/frontend/lib` (e.g., `localhost:3000`) are correctly configured to match the exposed ports in the compose file. Conflicts may occur if another service (like Next.js or React) is already using the same port.

## üîê Secrets & Environment Variables

This project makes use of `.env` files for local development, but **no sensitive credentials are committed** to the repository.

- For **local development**, create your own `.env` file based on `.env.example`.
- For **CI/CD and production**, all secrets (such as API keys, tokens, database URLs) are securely stored in **GitHub Secrets**.

‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit `.env` files containing real credentials.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Integration

We use **GitHub Actions** to automate our deployment process. Upon each push to the main branch:

- Docker images are built.
- Images are pushed to the container registry.
- They are then pulled into the production VM.
- Nginx is used as the reverse proxy with domain configuration.
