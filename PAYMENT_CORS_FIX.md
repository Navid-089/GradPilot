# SSLCommerz CORS Fix Implementation

## Problem
SSLCommerz was redirecting users directly to backend API endpoints after payment completion, causing CORS errors because the redirect didn't originate from your frontend domain.

## Solution
Changed SSLCommerz callback URLs to redirect to frontend pages instead of backend APIs. The frontend pages then make proper API calls with CORS headers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Backend Configuration
**File:** `services/recommendation/src/main/resources/application.properties`

**Before (causing CORS):**
```properties
sslcommerz.success.url=https://gradpilot.me/api/recommendations/payment/success
sslcommerz.fail.url=https://gradpilot.me/api/recommendations/payment/fail  
sslcommerz.cancel.url=https://gradpilot.me/api/recommendations/payment/cancel
```

**After (fixed):**
```properties
sslcommerz.success.url=https://gradpilot.me/payment/success
sslcommerz.fail.url=https://gradpilot.me/payment/fail
sslcommerz.cancel.url=https://gradpilot.me/payment/cancel
```

### 2. Frontend Pages (Already Implemented Correctly)
Your frontend pages are already properly implemented:

- **`/payment/success`** - Handles success callback, validates payment via API
- **`/payment/fail`** - Handles failed payments
- **`/payment/cancel`** - Handles cancelled payments

## How It Works Now

1. **User initiates payment** → Frontend calls backend to initialize payment
2. **SSLCommerz processes payment** → User completes payment on SSLCommerz
3. **SSLCommerz redirects** → `https://gradpilot.me/payment/success?tran_id=xxx&val_id=yyy`
4. **Frontend page loads** → Success page extracts URL parameters
5. **Frontend validates payment** → Makes API call to `/api/recommendations/payment/validate`
6. **No CORS issues** → API call originates from your frontend domain

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Rebuild Recommendation Service Only
```bash
cd services/recommendation
docker build -t ananyapromi3/gradpilot-recommendation:latest .
docker push ananyapromi3/gradpilot-recommendation:latest
```

### Option 2: Full Rebuild (Recommended)
```bash
# Stop services
docker compose down

# Rebuild and restart with memory limits
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Option 3: Update Environment Variables
Instead of rebuilding, you can set environment variables:
```bash
export SSLCOMMERZ_SUCCESS_URL="https://gradpilot.me/payment/success"
export SSLCOMMERZ_FAIL_URL="https://gradpilot.me/payment/fail"  
export SSLCOMMERZ_CANCEL_URL="https://gradpilot.me/payment/cancel"
```

## Memory Optimization (Added Bonus)

Your `docker-compose.yml` now includes memory limits to prevent RAM issues:

- **Chatbot**: 768MB (AI processing needs more memory)
- **Recommendation**: 768MB (ML algorithms need more memory)  
- **Frontend**: 512MB (React/Next.js moderate usage)
- **SOP-review**: 512MB (Document processing)
- **Login-reg**: 384MB (Lightweight auth service)
- **Forum**: 384MB (Simple CRUD operations)

**Total allocation:** ~3.3GB out of 4GB available

## Testing the Fix

1. Start a payment process
2. Complete payment on SSLCommerz sandbox
3. You should be redirected to `https://gradpilot.me/payment/success`
4. The page should validate the payment successfully without CORS errors
5. Check browser console - no CORS errors should appear

## Monitoring

Monitor memory usage after deployment:
```bash
docker stats
```

This shows real-time memory consumption per container.
