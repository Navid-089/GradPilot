# SSLCommerz CORS Fix Implementation

## Problem
SSLCommerz was redirecting users directly to backend API endpoints after payment completion, causing CORS errors because the redirect didn't originate from your frontend domain.

## Solution
Changed SSLCommerz callback URLs to redirect to frontend pages instead of backend APIs. The frontend pages then make proper API calls with CORS headers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Backend Configuration
**File:** `services/recommendation/src/main/resources/application.properties`

**Before (causing CORS):**
```properties
sslcommerz.success.url=https://gradpilot.me/api/recommendations/payment/success
sslcommerz.fail.url=https://gradpilot.me/api/recommendations/payment/fail  
sslcommerz.cancel.url=https://gradpilot.me/api/recommendations/payment/cancel
```

**After (fixed):**
```properties
sslcommerz.success.url=https://gradpilot.me/payment/success
sslcommerz.fail.url=https://gradpilot.me/payment/fail
sslcommerz.cancel.url=https://gradpilot.me/payment/cancel
```

### 2. Updated Environment Variables
**File:** `.env`

**Before (causing CORS):**
```env
SSLCOMMERZ_SUCCESS_URL=https://gradpilot.me/api/recommendations/payment/success
SSLCOMMERZ_FAIL_URL=https://gradpilot.me/api/recommendations/payment/fail
SSLCOMMERZ_CANCEL_URL=https://gradpilot.me/api/recommendations/payment/cancel
```

**After (fixed):**
```env
SSLCOMMERZ_SUCCESS_URL=https://gradpilot.me/payment/success
SSLCOMMERZ_FAIL_URL=https://gradpilot.me/payment/fail
SSLCOMMERZ_CANCEL_URL=https://gradpilot.me/payment/cancel
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to both PaymentController and PaymentService to help debug any 500 Internal Server Errors.

### 4. Frontend Pages (Already Implemented Correctly)
Your frontend pages are already properly implemented:

- **`/payment/success`** - Handles success callback, validates payment via API
- **`/payment/fail`** - Handles failed payments
- **`/payment/cancel`** - Handles cancelled payments

## Current Status: CORS Fixed, Debugging 500 Error

‚úÖ **CORS Issue**: Fixed  
üîç **500 Internal Server Error**: Under investigation with debug logs

## How to Debug the 500 Error

### 1. Rebuild the Recommendation Service
```bash
cd services/recommendation
docker build -t ananyapromi3/gradpilot-recommendation:latest .
docker push ananyapromi3/gradpilot-recommendation:latest

# Or rebuild all services
cd ../..
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
```

### 2. Monitor the Logs
```bash
# Watch recommendation service logs
docker logs -f gradpilot-recommendation

# Or if using docker compose
docker compose logs -f recommendation
```

### 3. Test Payment Validation
When you complete a payment and get redirected to the success page, check the logs for:
- "=== PAYMENT VALIDATION REQUEST ===" 
- "Transaction ID: ..."
- "Validation ID: ..."
- Any error messages or stack traces

### 4. Common Issues to Check
- **Database Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL is accessible
- **Transaction ID Format**: Should match "GRADPILOT_" + timestamp
- **SSLCommerz Validation**: Check if SSLCommerz validation API is responding
- **Missing Payment Record**: Verify payment was created during initialization

## Deployment Instructions

```bash
# Stop services
docker compose down

# Rebuild and restart with memory limits
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Memory Optimization (Added Bonus)

Your `docker-compose.yml` now includes memory limits to prevent RAM issues:

- **Chatbot**: 768MB (AI processing needs more memory)
- **Recommendation**: 768MB (ML algorithms need more memory)  
- **Frontend**: 512MB (React/Next.js moderate usage)
- **SOP-review**: 512MB (Document processing)
- **Login-reg**: 384MB (Lightweight auth service)
- **Forum**: 384MB (Simple CRUD operations)

**Total allocation:** ~3.3GB out of 4GB available

## Testing the Fix

1. Start a payment process
2. Complete payment on SSLCommerz sandbox
3. You should be redirected to `https://gradpilot.me/payment/success`
4. Check browser console - no CORS errors should appear
5. Check server logs for detailed payment validation process
6. If 500 error occurs, logs will show exactly where it fails

## Monitoring

Monitor memory usage after deployment:
```bash
docker stats
```

Monitor logs in real-time:
```bash
docker compose logs -f recommendation
```

This shows real-time memory consumption per container and detailed payment processing logs.
